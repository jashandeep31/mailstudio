Create a fully responsive MJML email template for the product launch of the iPhone 17 Pro Max, strictly adhering to Apple's minimalist brand aesthetic. The design should utilize a clean layout, generous whitespace, and a monochromatic color palette (white, black, and light gray) with high-contrast typography. Use a sans-serif font stack (Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif) to mimic the system look.

The template must include the following sections:

1. **Header:** A minimalist top section with a centered Apple logo icon on a white background.

2. **Hero Section:** A stunning, full-width section featuring a large placeholder image for the device. Beneath the image, include a bold, high-impact headline reading "iPhone 17 Pro Max" and a refined subheadline "Hello, Future."

3. **Call to Action:** A distinct section highlighting the pre-order availability. Display the text "Sales start January 21st" clearly. Include a centered, pill-shaped primary button with a blue background (#0071e3) and white text reading "Pre-book Now".

4. **Product Features Grid:** A responsive `mj-section` with two columns. Each column should feature a small image placeholder or icon followed by short descriptive text highlighting features (e.g., "New Titanium Design" and "Next-Gen A19 Chip").

5. **Footer:** A sleek, light-gray background section containing legal text, copyright information for Apple Inc., links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and an unsubscribe link, all styled in small, muted gray text.

Ensure code quality allows for seamless rendering across all major email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail) and prioritize mobile responsiveness.
