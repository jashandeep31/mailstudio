Generate a production-ready, minimalist MJML email template for an OTP verification email for a brand called Mail Studio. The design must reflect the brand's aesthetic: clean, modern, and professional. Use a light gray background (#F5F5F5) for the body and a white container with rounded corners for the main content card. The primary brand accent color should be a deep teal (#006855), derived from the brand's UI buttons. Structure the email as follows: 1. Header: Centered Mail Studio logo (use a placeholder image URL or styled text) with ample padding. 2. Main Content: A clear, bold headline reading 'Verify your email address'. A concise body paragraph stating 'Please use the verification code below to confirm your email address as a test mail on our platform.' 3. OTP Section: Display a large, 6-digit placeholder code (e.g., 123 456) centered prominently. Style this code with a large font size, heavy weight, and distinct letter spacing, placed inside a light background box (e.g., very pale teal or light gray) to ensure it stands out visually. 4. Secondary Info: A small, subtle text note below the code indicating 'This code is valid for 10 minutes. If you did not request this, please ignore this email.' 5. Footer: A minimal footer section containing the text '© Mail Studio', a placeholder physical address, and a discreet unsubscribe link. Ensure the template is fully responsive, mobile-first, compatible with major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail), and uses web-safe sans-serif fonts.
