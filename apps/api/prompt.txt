Generate a complete, production-ready MJML email template for a brand named Mail Studio. The design must adhere to a strict black and white minimalist color palette to reflect the brand identity. The primary purpose of this email is to deliver a 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP) for account verification.

The template must include the following structural elements:

1. Header: A white background featuring the Mail Studio logo or brand name in bold black typography, centered at the top.

2. Body Section:
   - A clean white background.
   - A clear, bold headline: Verify your email address.
   - Introductory text: Please use the verification code below to complete your test mail setup.
   - The OTP Component: A distinct, centered visual block displaying a placeholder 6-digit code (e.g., 123 456). Use a large, bold font size and high contrast (black text on white or light gray background) to ensure it is the focal point.
   - Disclaimer text: Mention that the code is valid for a limited time (e.g., 10 minutes) and advise the user to ignore the email if they did not request it.

3. Footer: A contrasting black background with white text. Include a copyright notice for Mail Studio, a placeholder physical address, and an unsubscribe link.

Technical Requirements:
- Use valid MJML syntax throughout.
- Ensure the layout is fully responsive, optimizing for mobile devices first.
- Use standard, cross-client compatible sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Arial).
- Ensure high contrast ratios for accessibility.
- Implement client-specific workarounds for Outlook and Gmail compatibility.
