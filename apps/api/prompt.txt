Generate a professional MJML email template for a brand named "Mail Studio," utilizing a strict black and white monochromatic color scheme. The purpose of this email is a transactional OTP (One-Time Password) verification message.

The MJML code must adhere to the following specifications:

1. Global Styles:
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF).
- Text color: Black (#000000) or Dark Grey (#333333).
- Typography: Clean sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif).
- Layout: Mobile-first, responsive design compatible with Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.

2. Header Section:
- Clean white background.
- Centered brand logo or text header reading "MAIL STUDIO" in bold, uppercase, black typography.

3. Main Body Section:
- Headline: Large, bold text saying "Verify Your Email Address".
- Introductory text: "Thank you for choosing Mail Studio. To complete your sign-in, please use the verification code below."
- OTP Display: A distinct, centered visual container (light grey background or black border) displaying a placeholder 6-digit code (e.g., "849 021") in a large, tracking-spaced font size to ensure legibility.
- Security Notice: Small text below the code stating, "This code is valid for 10 minutes. If you did not request this, please ignore this email."
- Call to Action: A full-width or centered button with a solid black background and white text reading "Verify Account" as a fallback link.

4. Footer Section:
- Background color: Black (#000000).
- Text color: White (#FFFFFF) or Light Grey (#CCCCCC).
- Content: Copyright information (© 2023 Mail Studio), a placeholder physical address, and links for "Privacy Policy" and "Unsubscribe."

Ensure the output is valid, error-free MJML code with proper nesting of mj-section, mj-column, mj-text, and mj-button components.
